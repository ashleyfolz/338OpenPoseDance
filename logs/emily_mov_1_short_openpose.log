---------------------------------- WARNING ----------------------------------
We have introduced an additional boost in accuracy in the CUDA version of about 0.2% with respect to the CPU/OpenCL versions. We will not port this to CPU given the considerable slow down in speed it would add to it. Nevertheless, this accuracy boost is almost insignificant so the CPU/OpenCL versions can be safely used.
